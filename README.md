# PredictAnimeSuccess

This is one of my college final project about predicting the anime's success based on their rating websites' rating.

We, as a group, worked on it by visualizaing the data with graphs and decision trees.
For the visualization of Machine Learning results, we used Confusion Matrix.

The result was not too favorable as they have other confounding variables. But we are optimistic that if conditions met, our programs would work perfect.
