    "<img src=\"Crunchyroll.png\" width=500>\n",

    "- description\n",
    "- release year\n",

    "### Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our data has already been compiled into a data set, not that much pre-processing is needed. We will load all of the raw data into a data frame `df_anime`. As mentioned above, a new column will be added to this rudimentary data frame, `avg_score`, which will be the computed average score between the IMDb and TMDb scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this is computed, a new data frame, `df_anime_feat`, will be compiled with only the necessary features (listed above) for our model. This will simply remove those that are not needed for the analysis. All rows with missing data will be discarded. Altough this step significantly reduces the size of the data from 1081 to 639 rows, it is necessary for our model to function (looked at `df_anime_feat.shape()` before and after discarding rows). Additionally, to make the classification of genres easier, separate columns for each specific genre, `genre_name` will be made, and the values for that column will be `bool`, indicating whether a specific title is associated with that genre or not. The process will be the following:\n",
    "- Clean up the `genres` column: it is a str which represents a list of the genres.\n",
    "    - Make a `final_genres` list that contains all the unique genres in the data set.\n",
    "- Create new columns, `genre_name`, and indicate with a `bool` whether the given anime is categorized as that genre or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make each feature comparable, another data frame will be made, `df_anime_feat_std`, which will contain standardized values for the quantitative features (this will not include `title` or `certification`). This will help make our model more effective down the line.\n",

Each dot represents an anime title, categorized by the year it was released and the average score it has received. It is labeled based on its age certification category. When the user hovers over any dot, they can find that information along with the anime's title, the genres associated with it, and the number of seasons it has. This visualization attempts to show the user all of the information that will be used for the model. Although the points are too clustered to analyze how age_certification is spread out throughout our dataset, we can see that most of the anime were released within the last decade. Furthermore, we can see how on average these anime are scored above 7. It seems as though more recent animes are well-liked among viewers. It also appears that the majority of the anime observer in the dataset has an age certification of TV-14.\n",

It would probably be beneficial to have more websites providing scores to have a better `avg_score`, but we thought it would be an interesting feature to visualize."

    "The user inputs a list of titles they’ve watched and enjoyed, and based on the features of these shows (`release_year`, `age_certification`, etc.), the model tries to predict a list of anime that the user might like. We think that **k-NN** is the best because we can pass a list of features from the list of anime and return a list of titles that are similar to the anime that the user has watched. We think that, the more similar an anime is to the list the user has inputted, the better the recommendation. This approach will likely also work for the second feature we want to include, which predicts anime based on a list of features the user inputs. Finding the titles that most resemble that list would be a successful find.\n",
